# SugarFoam

`sugarfoam` is a library written in Go, based on the delightful [Bubble
Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea), aiming to provide a higher-level API compared to the latter. With `sugarfoam`, it is possible to develop TUI applications that present organized components in layouts. Compared to `BubbleTea`, it tries to save a bit of boilerplate code, especially if you want to develop applications that present articulated components such as tabgroup, statusbar, etc.
