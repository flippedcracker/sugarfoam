# SugarFoam

SugarFoam is a library written in Go, based on the delightful [Bubble
Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea), aiming to provide a higher-level API compared to the latter. With SugarFoam, it is possible to develop TUI applications that present organized components in layouts. Compared to `BubbleTea`, it tries to save a bit of boilerplate code, especially if you want to develop applications that present articulated components such as tabgroup, statusbar, etc.

# Features

- High-level API based on [Bubble
Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) for building TUI applications
- Idiomatic approach to building applications that preserves the architecture inspired by [Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/)
- Ability to define layouts for rendering components
