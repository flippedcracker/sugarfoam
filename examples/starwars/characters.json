Raddus","description":"A gruff Mon Calamari officer, Raddus commands
the rebel starfleet before the Battle of Yavin, working to knit a
hodgepodge of ships into a military force and arrange the delivery of
new capital ships to the Alliance. Raddus has little patience for the
rebel council’s endless committee meetings. As he sees it, military
muscle is the key to defeating the Empire, not stirring
speeches.","image":"https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/admiral-raddus-main_33194c80.jpeg","__v":0},{"_id":"64292927021f17e13fbc1e59","name":"Admiral

to maintain order in the name of the Empire, not to tell the truth or
anything close to
it.","image":"https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/alton-kastle_bf3196be.jpeg","__v":0},{"_id":"64292927021f17e13fbc1e71","name":"Anakin
Skywalker","description":"Discovered as a slave on Tatooine by Qui-Gon
xJinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker had the potential to become
one of the most powerful Jedi ever. Some even believed he was the

pushing the limits of his Jedi training, seeking to excel and live up

Anakin was caring and compassionate, but suffered from a deep fear of
loss that would prove to be his
